**AI chatbot used: ChatGPT**

You're a front-end developer with UX/UI experience and I want to create a web page with vanilla JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string.

For example, if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA.

Do it by creating an HTML index.html file with the title "Session 1: Reverse String". The user will have an input text (with labels for accessibility) to write the sentence to reverse, and a button to reverse the sentence.
After clicking the button you need to show the reverse string in a paragraph and clean the input text for the next incoming text.
For the functionality create a script.js file to create the function reverseString to do the action, and include some test cases for that function.
As you're a frontend developer I want to set some styles in a separate file styles.css to be more user-friendly.

Remember to set the tags script and styles inside the HTML file
