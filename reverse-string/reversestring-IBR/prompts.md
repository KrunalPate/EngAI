Bellow of it will hace a row with thow elements in the middle too. On this row, in the first position we will have an input text element with a placeholder that says: 'Introduce the text'. After this input text element, we will have a button on blue color with 5 pixels of left padding with the following text: 'Reverse text'. Bellow this row, we will have another row on center in the middle with two elements: Firstable, we will have an span element on black bold that should show: 'Reversed text:'. On its right, we will have another span element in green color.
