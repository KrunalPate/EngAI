Hi! I would like to create a simple page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (last stable versions for each one) where I can introduce a text and the text is returned reversed in the same page without reloading. So, if I have the input AI4Devs, the value returned must be sveD4IA.

For HTML, the language of the page must be in English, but we can write with any latin language in the form.
For CSS, I want a responsive design using a perfomant library like Tailwind or a better one if you know.
For JS, I want pure JavaScript, not JQuery. The script of JS must be called at the end of the page.

Functions and variables in all the code must be in English and I would like to keep a panel in the right with of the last 10 searches. If the page is reloaded, the historic will be lost.

-----------------

Thanks. I would like to have the form centered in the screen horizontally and vertically. Between the 2 components I want a margin to have visually pretty. Instead of using the word "Text" use the word "String", replace to each necessary place.

When the reversed string appears, I want to show also the original one in the result. Maybe saying: "Original: normal string" and "Result: gnirts lamron".

Finally, the historic must be ordered viceversa, so in the first position the last result. Also, I want to show the reversed string in bold and just the line below with a more small font and in another color (kind of grey), the original string.

-----------------

Both component right now are too much small, could you increase the width of both a little?

Also, I don't like the style for the original and result after typing a string. I want to use the same kind of design used for the history. Thanks!

-----------------

Could you add some details?
- When we don't have any search, put a simple sentence "Reverse your first string to have history."
- Allow to copy in a easy way the reverted string, add a button next to the button of reverse or next to the reversed string
- Modify "Last 10 Searches" by "Last 10 results" and add an emoji at the beginning related to the title
- Remove "Enter a string:" text and add an emoji to the title "Reverse String"

-----------------

When I copy the reversed string the alert is annoying, could you replace with another element more friendly?
